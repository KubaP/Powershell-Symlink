# ISSUE WITH BUILT MODULE FILE
# ----------------------------
# If this module file contains the compiled code below, as this is a "packaged"
# build, then that code *must* be loaded, and you cannot individually import
# and of the code files, even if they are there.
# 
# 
# If this module file is built, then it contains the class definitions below,
# and on Import-Module, this file is AST analysed and those class definitions 
# are read-in and loaded.
# 
# It's only once a command is run that this module file is executed, and if at
# that point this file starts to individually import the project files, it will
# end up re-defining the classes, and apparently that seems to cause issues 
# later down the line.
# 
# 
# Therefore to prevent this issue, if this module file has been built and it
# contains the compile code below, that code will be used, and nothing else.
# 
# The build script should also not package the individual files, so that the
# *only* possibility is to load the compiled code below and there is no way
# the individual files can be imported, as they don't exist.


# If this module file contains the compiled code, import that, but if it doesn't, then import the
# individual files instead.
