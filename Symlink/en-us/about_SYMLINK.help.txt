SHORT DESCRIPTION
    Explains how the Symlink module can be used to manage symbolic links on the
    filesystem.
    
    
    
OVERVIEW
 == This module manages symlink definitions (properties defined in a database)
    and the actual symbolic-link items on the filesystem. It allows for the
    creation of symlink definitions, which exist until removed. The module also
    allows for the creation of the symbolic-link items on the filesystem, which
    may or may not exist. An example use of this module would be if you have a
    separate partition with game save data stored there (files moved from the 
    usual %appdata% location), and you want to easily create/modify/remove the
    symbolic-links required to make the games read that data.
    
    
 == When specifying any paths for any of the cmdlets, you can include
    environment variables in the '%VARIABLE%' notation. These will then get
    expanded when necessary, assuming the variable is defined on the system.
    
 [!]If the environment variable is modified, you can update the symlinks target
    to point to the new path by running the `Build-Symlink` cmdlet.
    
 [!]If an environment variable is used in the path of a symlink definition, then
    running the `Build-Symlink` cmdlet will create a new item at the new 
    location, however, the old item will remain on the filesystem since the
    cmdlet has no way of figuring out what the old path of an environment
    variable used to be.
    
    
 == The cmdlets in this module operate on [Symlink] objects. The objects
    retrieved by the `Get-Symlink` cmdlet can be piped to:
        - Remove-Symlink
        - Set-Symlink
        - Build-Symlink
    
    
 == This module has custom-defined formatting outputs for:
        -------	        -----
        Cmdlet	        Alias
        -------         -----
        Format-List     fl
        Format-Table    ft
        Format-Custom   fc
        Format-Wide     fw
    
    The `Format-Custom` & `Format-List` views contain the largest amount
    of information regarding the symlink.
    
    
 == A font with ligatures is recommended for the best and clearest visual
    display.
    
    When running in the 'Windows Terminal', fancy formatting is supported.
    This formatting uses colours and emojis to make the output even clearer
    and easier to read/scan through.
    
    
 == The cmdlets in this module have default aliases:
        -------	        -----
        Cmdlet	        Alias
        -------         -----
        New-Symlink     nsl
        Get-Symlink     gsl
        Set-Symlink     ssl
        Remove-Symlink  rsl
        Build-Symlink   bsl
    
    
    
CREATING A SYMLINK
 == To create a new symlink, run:
    
        PS C:\> New-Symlink -Name "data" -Path "~\Documents\Data"
                 -Target D:\Files
    
    This command will create a new symlink definition, named "data", and a
    symbolic-link located in the user's document folder under a folder also
    named "Data", pointing to a folder on the "D:\" drive.
    
    -Name
        Specifies the name of the symlink to be created; must be unique.

    
    -Path
        Specifies the path of the location of the symbolic-link item. If any
        parent folders in this path don't exist, they will be created.
    
    -Target
        Specifies the path of the target which the symbolic-link item points to.
	    This also defines whether the symbolic-link points to a directory or
        a file.
    
    OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
    
    -CreationCondition
        Specifies a scriptblock to be used for this symlink. This scriptblock
	    decides whether the symbolic-link item should be created on the
        filesystem. For detailed help, see the "CREATION CONDITION SCRIPTBLOCK"
        section in the help at: 'about_Symlink'.
    
    -DontCreateItem
        Prevents the creation of the symbolic-link item on the filesystem.
	    (The symlink definition will still be created).
    
    -Force
		Forces this cmdlet to create an symlink that writes over an existing
        one. Even using this parameter, if the filesystem denies access to the
	    necessary files, this cmdlet can fail.
	
	-WhatIf
		Shows what would happen if the cmdlet runs. The cmdlet does not run.
		
	-Confirm
		Prompts you for confirmation before running any state-altering actions
		in this cmdlet.
		
	<CommonParameters>
        This cmdlet supports the common parameters: Verbose, Debug,
        ErrorAction, ErrorVariable, WarningAction, WarningVariable,
        OutBuffer, PipelineVariable, and OutVariable. For more information, see
        about_CommonParameters (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113216).

        PS C:\> Get-Symlink -Name "data"
    
    This command will retrieve the details of the symlink named "data", and
    print the details to the screen. The output of this cmdlet can be piped to
    a number of other cmdlets in this module.
    
    -Names
        Specifies the name(s) of the items to get.
	 [!]This parameter will autocomplete to valid symlink names.

        For more information, see about_CommonParameters
        (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113216).
    
    
 == To retrieve the details of all symlinks, run:
 
        PS C:\> Get-Symlink -All
        
    This command will retrieve the details of all symlinks, and print the
    details to the screen.
    
    -All
        Specifies to get all symlinks.
    
    OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
    
    <CommonParameters>
        This cmdlet supports the common parameters: Verbose, Debug,
        ErrorAction, ErrorVariable, WarningAction, WarningVariable,
        OutBuffer, PipelineVariable, and OutVariable. For more information, see
        about_CommonParameters (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113216).
    
    
    
CHANGING THE PROPERTIES OF A SYMLINK
 == To change the name of a symlink, run:
    
        PS C:\> Set-Symlink -Name "data" -Property "Name" -Value "WORK"
    
    This command will change the name of the symlink named "data", to the new
    name of "WORK". From now on, there is no symlink named "data" anymore.
    
    -Name
        Specifies the name of the symlink to be changed.
	 [!]This parameter will autocompleted to valid names for a symlink.
    
    -Property
        Specifies the name of the property to change.
	 [!]This parameter will autocompleted to the following: "Name", "Path",
	    "Target", "CreationCondition".
    
    -Value
	    Specifies the new value of the property being changed.
    
    OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
    
    -WhatIf
	    Shows what would happen if the cmdlet runs. The cmdlet does not run.
	
    -Confirm
        Prompts you for confirmation before running any state-altering actions
        in this cmdlet.
    
    <CommonParameters>
        This cmdlet supports the common parameters: Verbose, Debug,
        ErrorAction, ErrorVariable, WarningAction, WarningVariable,
        OutBuffer, PipelineVariable, and OutVariable. For more information, see
        about_CommonParameters (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113216).
    
    
 == To change any other properties of a symlink, run:
    
        PS C:\> Set-Symlink -Name "data" -Property <...> -Value <...>
    
    The new value will undergo the same checks and validations as when creating
    a new symlink using the `New-Symlink` cmdlet.
    
    
 [!]Changing the 'Path' property of a symlink, will result in the symbolic-link
    item being deleted from its original location, and re-created at the new
    location.
    
 [!]Changing the 'Target' property of a symlink, will result in the 
    symbolic-link item being deleted and re-created in the same location, but
    now pointing to the new target.
    
  [!]Changing the 'CreationCondition' will not change the current existence of
    the symbolic-link item, even if now the expression would evaluate to false.
    
    
    
REMOVING A SYMLINK
 == To delete a symlink, run:
    
        PS C:\> Remove-Symlink -Name "data"
        
    This command will delete a symlink definition, named "data", and delete the
    symbolic-link item from the filesystem.
    
    -Names
        Specifies the name(s) of the items to delete.
	 [!]This parameter will autocomplete to valid symlink names.
        
    OPTIONAL PARAMETER
	
    -DontDeleteItem
        Prevents the deletion of the symbolic-link item from the filesystem.
	    (The symlink definition will still be deleted).
    
	-WhatIf
		Shows what would happen if the cmdlet runs. The cmdlet does not run.
		
	-Confirm
		Prompts you for confirmation before running any state-altering actions
		in this cmdlet.
		
	<CommonParameters>
        This cmdlet supports the common parameters: Verbose, Debug,
        ErrorAction, ErrorVariable, WarningAction, WarningVariable,
        OutBuffer, PipelineVariable, and OutVariable. For more information, see
        about_CommonParameters (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113216).
    
    
    
BUILDING/UPDATING SYMLINKS
 == To create all symbolic-link items on the filesystem, run:
    
        PS C:\> Build-Symlink -All
    
    This command will go through all of the symlink definitions, and create 
    the symbolic-link items on the filesystem, assuming the creation condition
    for each is true.
    
    -All
        Specifies to create all symlinks.
    
    OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
    
    -Force
	    Forces this cmdlet to create a symbolic-link item on the filesystem even
	    if the creation condition is false. Even using this parameter, if the
	    filesystem denies access to the necessary files, this cmdlet can fail.
	
    -WhatIf
	    Shows what would happen if the cmdlet runs. The cmdlet does not run.
	
    -Confirm
        Prompts you for confirmation before running any state-altering actions
        in this cmdlet.
    
    <CommonParameters>
        This cmdlet supports the common parameters: Verbose, Debug,
        ErrorAction, ErrorVariable, WarningAction, WarningVariable,
        OutBuffer, PipelineVariable, and OutVariable. For more information, see
        about_CommonParameters (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113216).
    
    
 == To create only certain symbolic-links on the filesystem, run:
    
        PS C:\> Build-Symlink -Names "data","files"
    
    This command will only go through the symlinks given in, and create the
    items on the filesystem.
    
    -Names
        Specifies the name(s) of the symlinks to create.
	 [!]This parameter will autocomplete to valid symlink names.
    
    OPTIONAL PARAMETERS
    
    -Force
	    Forces this cmdlet to create a symbolic-link item on the filesystem even
	    if the creation condition is false. Even using this parameter, if the
	    filesystem denies access to the necessary files, this cmdlet can fail.
	
    -WhatIf
	    Shows what would happen if the cmdlet runs. The cmdlet does not run.
	
    -Confirm
        Prompts you for confirmation before running any state-altering actions
        in this cmdlet.
    
    <CommonParameters>
        This cmdlet supports the common parameters: Verbose, Debug,
        ErrorAction, ErrorVariable, WarningAction, WarningVariable,
        OutBuffer, PipelineVariable, and OutVariable. For more information, see
        about_CommonParameters (https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=113216).
        
    
 == This command can be used if you're given a database file, and want to
    create the symbolic-link items for the first time.
    
 [!]This command can also be used to update existing items. Whilst the
    `Set-Symlink` cmdlet will update the symbolic-link items on the filesystem,
    changing an environment variable will not. If you change the value of an
    environment variable, you can run this command to "re-build" all of the
    symbolic-link items and either change their location or their target
    (if either reference the changed variable).
    
    
    
CREATION CONDITION SCRIPTBLOCK
 == When creating a new symlink, or by setting the property using the 
    `Set-Symlink` cmdlet, you can define a "Creation Condition" scriptblock.
    This scriptblock gets evaluated when the actual symbolic-link item is 
    being created on the filesystem, and it determines whether it should or
    should not be created.
    
    
    For example, the scriptblock could check for the machine name, and only 
    create the symlink on certain computers.
    
        The scriptblock would look like:
        
            if ($env:COMPUTERNAME -eq "specific-name"){
                return $TRUE
            }else{
                return $FALSE
            }
        
        Then when the `Build-Symlink` cmdlet is run, this scriptblock will be
        evaluated and decide whether the creation should go through or not.
        
      [!]The scriptblock must return '$TRUE' or '$FALSE' values from all control
        paths. This cannot be checked by the module, so the user **must** make
        sure of this.
    
    
    This allows the use of the same database file across multiple machines for
    instance, even if the individual machines have slightly varying requirements
    regarding which symlinks are actually needed to exist on the filesystem.
    
    
    
OTHER
 == The module stores all data in '%APPDATA%\Powershell\Symlink'. It is advised
    to **not** manually modify any files within this directory as it could
    cause unintended consequences.
